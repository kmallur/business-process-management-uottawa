# Real-Time Location System(RTLS) #

## Introduction ##

A real-time location system(RTLS) is a system in which we have tagged entities that continuously transmit their location which is then received and computed. In an RTLS, we have transmitters and receivers. The transmitters are the entities that need to be tracked. The transmitters wear a tag, like an RFID. Receivers are the static part of the system and would be located throughout the place in which the entities would be tracked. How the entities' locations are determined depend on the system. Different systems have different algorithms. For example, a system could use Wi-Fi fingerprinting. Another system might use Wi-Fi triangulation. Implemented systems that aim for accuracy will usually be mixed and use different algorithms together[[1](RTLS#References.md)].
