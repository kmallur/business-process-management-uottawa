  1. Choose whether you want to add an Input, an Output, or a Private variable.
  1. Click on the Add button of the variable of your choice and name your variable. The convention is to start your variable name with a lowercase letter.
  1. Click on Select to choose the Variable Type. Clicking on New lets you define a new type of Business Object and is rarely used at this step. If you want your variable to contain a list of the selected type, check the Is List checkbox.
