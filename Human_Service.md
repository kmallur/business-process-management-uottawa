#Human Service.

# Introduction #

Human service is a kind of interactive service which allows us to add a step into our business process definition(BPD) in order to create an interactive task that "process participants" can perform in a web-based interface. The main purpose of implementing human services in BPD is not only to improve the quality of service delivery systems but also to improvise on accessibility, accountability and coordination among process participants in the service delivery.

## Example Usage ##

- If an activity requires a call center employee to enter data about   customer order requests then we create a human service.So basically these are services with human interactions.

## Human services with coaches ##

When you build Human services, you include coaches, which are the web-based forms that provide process-related data to end users as well as collect input from those users. Coaches enable you to easily add standard fields and controls such as radio buttons, drop-down menus etc. This will allow the end users to participate in a business process by creating web based interface.

## Procedure to create a new human service ##

1. In the designer view, select the plus sign next to "User Interface" option. A drop down menu will be displayed.

4. Later on after creating a human service you can drag and drop a coach from the component pallete as shown below to create a web based interface for end users.

**Note:** _When developing a service diagram in the Designer in IBM Process Designer,not all components are available for each type of service. Coaches are only available for human services._
