### Analysis Studio ###

Users can create analyses of large data sources and search for background information about an event or action. Multidimensional analysis allows identifying trends and understanding of anomalies or deviations, which are not obvious in other types of reports. Drag-and-drop features, elements and key performance indicators can be included in the analysis, rows and columns can be switched, OLAP-functionalities like drill-up and drill-down can be used to get a deeper understanding about the sources of the information used in the analysis.

### Event Studio ###

The Event Studio is a notification tool that informs about events within the enterprise in real time. Therefore, agents can be created to detect the occurrence of business events or exceptional circumstances, based on the change of specified event- or data conditions. A notification may be served by sending an e-mail, its publication in the portal, or by triggering reports.
