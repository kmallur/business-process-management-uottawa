**1) How to Archive the Business Process Project?**

Archiving the project in Process Designer simply mean, hiding the project from listing it among the other available processes. By archiving, the user is not deleting the process nor is he freeing DB space.

To archive a process in designer, simply select that process and navigate to manage section and click on 'Archive Process App' option as shown in the below screenshot. This process will henceforth won't be listed under 'Process Apps'.

The archived process tracks can be viewed from the same screen as shown in the above screenshot. The user is given an option to restore the archived track from this screen.

The user can restore the archived process from the process Apps screen too. He first needs to click on 'Archived' option from the Process Apps screen, which would list the archived processes. He should then select the process that he wants to restore and click on 'Restore' option.
By doing this, the process is no more archived and is now seen in the process listing.
